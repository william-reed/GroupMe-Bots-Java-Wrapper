GroupMe Java Wrapper
==
A Java wrapper for the GroupMe bots api


Example usage:
--
```java
//create your bot with the ID assigned to you (GroupMe bot creation link below)
Bot bot = new Bot("your bot id here");
//send a simple text only message
bot.sendTextMessage("Test message");
//send an image with text along with it
bot.sendImage("Check out this image", "http://www.wtt.com/Pictures/WTT_logo_color_Jan2010.gif");
//send a location to the chat
bot.sendLocation("Home", 38.8977, -77.0366, "The White House");
```
In order to add the projects code to your project download the most recent version from [here](https://github.com/wreed12345/GroupMe-Java-API/tree/master/builds) and add the jar as a library in your java build path. To obtain a bot with an ID use [this form](https://dev.groupme.com/bots/new). After creation use the bot id as a parameter when you create your bot object.
Here are some other useful links:
- [GroupMe docs](https://dev.groupme.com/docs/v3)
- [Request response codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) can be used to determine debug messages (you will know them when you see them)
